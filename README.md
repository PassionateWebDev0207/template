# template

### Tasks
1. display a list of users `display_picture` and `display_name` which expands to show all their post `thumbnails`.

2. Use only the vue composition api i.e. don't use `data: {}, methods: {}` etc.

3. Write jest tests for the `user.vue` component

4. As you work, commit changes to your local copy of this repo

You can add more features if you would like but it is not necessary. Quality over quantity

### More Info
There is a starter template in `pages/users.vue`. Edit that file instead of starting a new one.

You can access that page with `yarn dev` and accessing `http://localhost:3000/users`

GraphiQL editor can be found at https://moved-phoenix-38.hasura.app/console/

You will need to create a hasura cloud account and login.

I will add you to the staging project collaborators.
